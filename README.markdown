# Cedar Boilerplate

The goal of this boilerplate is to provide a sample iOS project with [Pivotal's Cedar BDD-style testing framework](https://github.com/pivotal/cedar) already integrated. This will allow new developers to more easily learn the iOS BDD testing framework by providing code samples, and to allow other developers to quickly start their own projects and use Cedar from the beginning.

This boilerplate was based on:
* The cocoa touch utility application template
* Without ARC
* Without storyboards

## TODO

* Provide example of shared example groups
* Improve test coverage of FlipsideViewController and MainViewController
* Cedar + OCUnit support, maybe?
* Script to clean out all the example files for when the bp is used for a fresh new project

## TODONE

* Setup the UI testing target
* Setup the domain testing target
